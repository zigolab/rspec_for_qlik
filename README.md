# ... a little rspec(t) for Qlikview

This is the companion project of my post [a little rspec(t) for Qlikview](http://zigolab.it/a-little-rspec-t-for-qlikview/)

## setup notes
In the git project there is no testbed.qvw file. You will find, instead, a folder called testbed-prj, containing the "xml" content of the original file. In order to create the correct testbed.qvw file, just create a new and empty qvw file named testbed.qvw, open it and save it (under the hood, Qlikview will load the content from the testbed-pro folder...).
